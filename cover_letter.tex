	With a solid foundation in machine learning and 3D motion animation, I believe I am well-suited for the \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer} position at \textbf{Motorica AI}.
	
	My proposed \textbf{DeepGesture} model - a transformer-diffusion hybrid designed to generate gestures from multimodal input (speech, emotion, and semantics) - demonstrates both research depth and engineering capability. I have also worked with the ZeroEGGS retargeting dataset (Daniel Holden) and developed the \href{https://github.com/DeepGesture/DeepGesture-Unity}{DeepGesture-Unity} project (AI4Animation - Sebastian Starke) to render gesture results directly within Unity.
	
	I'm also a co-organizer of the \textbf{GENEA Leaderboard} and \textbf{HEMVIP}, a system for evaluating multiple gesture generation models using Prolific. These efforts reflect my commitment to both academic rigor and scalable, production-focused systems.

	I am deeply passionate about digital humans and motion synthesis, with demonstrated skills in 3D rendering using Blender, including high-fidelity assets from 3DScanStore and Universal Human rendering scenes. I am particularly drawn to Motorica’s emphasis on foundational motion models and their integration with AAA game studios. My experience with skeleton retargeting using MotionBuilder, as well as building blendshape-based facial rigs, aligns well with Motorica’s production needs.
	
	Additionally, I have practical experience with Unity, demonstrated through my own game projects, and a strong foundation in 3D animation workflows. I am confident that this combination of skills positions me to contribute meaningfully to Motorica’s initiatives.
	
%	I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my skill set, including diffusion model implementation, and 3D animation integration, and how can I directly support and accelerate Motorica’s research and production roadmap.
